 To compile all of the files, the command *make compile* can be used.
 To run the project, the command *make* or *make run* will ensure that the code complies if needed and then executes it.
 Finally, to test the project (using the test classes written by the developers) the command *make test* will compile (as needed) and execute the developers' test classes.

<List the efforts of any members on your team that went above the team's
 expectations for their contributions to this project.  Also identify any
 ways that team members failed to meet the expectations of the group, for
 example: missed deadlines, lack of communication, lack of effort, etc.>
 All members of my team have been wonderful to work with. Everyone has been working hard and I've never had any issues communicating with them.
 In general, I would say I am impressed by my team's work in regards to the projects as well as the teamwork aspect of the class.
 I would have to say though, Jonathan stood out in terms of helping us all debug various files.
